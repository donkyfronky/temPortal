# thermPortal
Light one page app that show temperature and humidity trend on Raspberry with DHT11 sensor

Project is under development, but already working.

Need:
- manage lib dependency between docker and Raspberry (now time npm install fail on docker env, because of "node-dht-sensor")
- client page wastes resources, need improvement
